/* --- [TASK] ---
Changes on modal are only applied on SAVE

CURRENT SCENARIO
- Clicking the `SettingsSelector`-Button opens a modal dialog.
- Changes to any of the select inputs are immediately effective.
- The modal is dismissed using the **[Close]** button

DESIRED SCENARIO
- Clicking the `SettingsSelector`-Button opens a modal dialog.
- There is a **[Save]** and a **[Cancel]** button, both serving to dismiss the modal.
- Changes are taking effect only on **[Save]**

FURTHER DETAILS
- Positioning of the buttons within the modal is not in the scope of this task
--- [TASK] --- */

/* --- [TASK] ---
Reduced number of unnecessary re-renders

CURRENT SCENARIO
- The `SettingsSelector`-Button re-renders too often
- It re-renders every time the modal is opened, closed, or on changing the select inputs

DESIRED SCENARIO
- The `SettingsSelector`-Button only re-renders when relevant data changes (Country, Language, Currency)

FURTHER DETAILS
- The `SettingsSelector`-Button has a render counter that will log to the console (do not remove)
- Be aware that #1 changes some relevant behaviour for this task
--- [TASK] --- */

/* --- [TASK] ---
Improved layout and styling of modal dialog (CSS)

CURRENT SCENARIO
- The modal dialog lacks intentional layout (spacings, dimensions).
- On smaller devices, the available space is not utilized effectively.

DESIRED SCENARIO
- Ensure consistent spacing, padding, and dimensions.
- Implement responsive or adaptive behavior for the modal, especially on smaller devices.

FURTHER DETAILS
- Focus on injecting and structuring CSS, using selectors and properties effectively.
- Feel free to apply your preferred spacing and dimensions; the provided designs mereley serve as examples. Just make sure it is consistent.
- Bonus points awarded for aesthetically appealing re-design of elements.
--- [TASK] --- */

/* --- [TASK] ---
Improved use of TypeScript

CURRENT SCENARIO
- In `SettingsSelector`, there are individual `useState()` calls for `Country`, `Language`, and `Currency`.
- Throughout the entire project, there are several instances of type `any`.
    Example: 
    ```typescript
    ... = React.useState<any>(DEFAULT_COUNTRY);
    ```
- Default values are constants that are exported by each component. 
    Example:
    ```typescript
    .... { DEFAULT_COUNTRY } from "../country/CountrySelect";
    ```

DESIRED SCENARIO
- Consolidate `Country`, `Language`, and `Currency` into a single "state".
- Extract default values from the components and make them configurable from a central point.
- Eliminate any remaining instances of type `any`.

OPTIONAL BONUS
- Replace `any` in the `*.stories.tsx`  files with appropriate types.

 ReactDOM.render is no longer supported

CURRENT SCENARIO
- There is an error logging in the console
    `Warning: ReactDOM.render is no longer supported in React 18. Use createRoot instead. Until you switch to the new API, your app will behave as if it's running React 17. Learn more: https://reactjs.org/link/switch-to-createroot`

DESIRED SCENARIO
- The error log does not appear
- The cause of the the warning is fixed

FURTHER DETAILS
- Downgrading to React 17 is not an option ðŸ˜‰
